              <h2>Vlkolínec - part of Unesco</h2>
              <p>
                Vlkolínec is a village under the administration of the town of
                Ružomberok in Slovakia. Historically, however, it was a separate
                village. The first written mention of the village came from 1376
                and after 1882 it became part of Ružomberok. Its name is
                probably derived from the Slovak word "vlk", i.e. wolf.
                Vlkolínec has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since
                1993, and is one of ten Slovak villages that have been given the
                status of a folk architecture reservations. This status was
                granted because the village is an untouched and complex example
                of folk countryside architecture of the region of the Northern
                Carpathians.

              <p>
                Very popular touristic delicacy hidden in the Chočské vrchy
                mountain range in Liptov region. Prosiek and Kvačany valleys are
                connected by circular path with parking spot. Prosiek valley is
                considered to be one of the most beautiful valleys in Slovakia.
                Especially for its karst formations and variety of different
                plants. In Kvačany valley you can get to know Kvačany mill,
                which is located in historic site of Oblazy. Among the biggest
                attractions of the Prosiek valley is the Red Sands waterfall.
                It's accesible via the hiking trail from Vidova. This trail is
                passing also thru the karst valley over wooden bridges and metal
                ladders. Some places are secured with chains and metal risers
                and for this reason we do not recommend entry with a dog.
                Although, if the water is low, dogs can pass thru the water
                stream under the path with chains.

                The Museum of the Liptov Village is significantly different from
                other museums in nature, primarily in the form of construction
                and the composition of the objects. It is the image of a
                medieval settlement with the privileges and rights of a small
                town. In addition to wooden residential and farm buildings,
                representing typical features of folk architecture of peasant
                and artisan classes, there are also two rare medieval stone
                buildings. All buildings together create a unique composition of
                the historical and cultural environment of ancient Liptov. The
                Gothic-Renaissance manor house from Parížovce village is the
                oldest preserved manor house in Liptov from the 14th-16th
                centuries and is associated with King Matej Corvín and his son
                Ján Corvín, Prince of Liptov. An attractive exhibit is the early
                Gothic church of the Virgin Mary from the village of Liptovská
                Mara with fragments of original wall paintings from the 14th and
                15th centuries. In the upper part of the museum area there is a
                functional track of the forest railway.
